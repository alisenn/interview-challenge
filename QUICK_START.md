# Quick Start Guide

## Easy Start (Windows)

### Option 1: Use Batch Files
1. Double-click `start-backend.bat` to start the backend server
2. Double-click `start-frontend.bat` to start the frontend server
3. Wait for both servers to fully start
4. Navigate to http://localhost:3000

### Option 2: Manual Start

## Running the Backend (Port 8080)

1. Open terminal in `backend` directory
2. Run: `npm install` (if not done already)
3. Run: `npm run start:dev`
4. Backend should start on http://localhost:8080

### Test Backend APIs:
- GET http://localhost:8080/patients
- GET http://localhost:8080/medications  
- GET http://localhost:8080/assignments

## Running the Frontend (Port 3000)

1. Open terminal in `frontend` directory
2. Run: `npm install` (if not done already)
3. Run: `npm run dev`
4. Frontend should start on http://localhost:3000

## Troubleshooting

### "Failed to load patients data" Error:
1. Make sure backend is running on port 8080
2. Check backend console for errors
3. Verify CORS is enabled (already configured)
4. Check browser network tab for actual error

### Common Issues:
- Backend not starting: Check if port 8080 is free
- Frontend not loading: Check if port 3000 is free
- API errors: Check backend logs for detailed error messages

## Testing the Application

1. Start backend server first
2. Start frontend server
3. Navigate to http://localhost:3000
4. You should see the dashboard with statistics
5. Try creating a patient first, then a medication, then an assignment
